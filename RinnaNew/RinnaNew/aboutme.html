        <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>\
        <p>I was born in Malm√∂, Sweden, a border city with Denmark across the sound. 
          After 20 years I felt it was time too get on the move, I always had itchy feet,
          sometimes going for 10+ hour walks or bicycle rides during my childhood.
        </p>
        <p>After a couple on the road, travelling Europe, Asia and spending 2 years
          on a working holiday in Australia, I settled down in Vietnam out of all places.
          During the pandemic I picked up coding as a hobby that grew into my future
          career. 
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not coding I teach English, help my friends, or work on my side businesses, 
          the little free time I have, I usually spend gardening, working on
          my Hip Hop songs, or driving my beautiful GSX-S 150.
        </p>
